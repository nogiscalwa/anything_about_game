The film depicts the early history of Islam, from the first revelation of Muhammad to the migration of the Muslims to Medina, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and the conquest of Mecca. The film does not show the face or voice of Muhammad or his close companions, following the Islamic tradition of respecting their sanctity. Instead, the film uses point-of-view shots, sound effects, and a narrator to convey their presence. The film also shows the diversity and tolerance of Islam, as it portrays Christians, Jews, and pagans living in harmony or conflict with the Muslims.
 
The film was a major success in the Muslim world, as it was one of the first films to portray the life of Muhammad and his companions in a respectful and accurate manner. The film also faced some controversy and censorship in some countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, where it was banned for depicting the companions of Muhammad. The film also faced some protests and threats from some extremist groups, such as the Nation of Islam in the United States, who objected to the portrayal of Islam by a non-Muslim director. However, the film also received praise and support from many Muslim leaders and scholars, such as Al-Azhar University in Egypt, who issued a fatwa approving the film.
 
Al-Risalah is considered a classic and influential film in Islamic cinema, as it inspired many other films and documentaries on the history and teachings of Islam.

The film is available in various formats, such as DVD, Blu-ray, and online streaming. The film can be watched in its original Arabic version or with subtitles in different languages.

The film also has a spiritual and educational value, as it introduces the viewers to the core beliefs and practices of Islam, such as the five pillars, the six articles of faith, the Quran, the Sunnah, and the Sharia. The film also highlights the moral and ethical values of Islam, such as justice, mercy, compassion, honesty, and generosity. The film also shows the challenges and struggles that the early Muslims faced in their mission to spread the message of Islam, such as persecution, oppression, war, and betrayal. The film also depicts the miracles and signs that accompanied the prophethood of Muhammad, such as the splitting of the moon, the night journey, and the revelation of the Quran.
